            <h1>Hoax Bomb Threats at CRPF Schools: The Chaos that Wasn't</h1>
            <p>
                Imagine starting your day with a cup of tea, only to find out that schools across the country, including Delhi, received bomb threats! Total panic ensued, with students evacuated, parents freaking out, and police rushing in—only for it to be a hoax. This email threat came right after an explosion outside a CRPF school in Delhi, adding to the chaos. Thankfully, authorities confirmed that the threats were false, but the mass evacuation definitely stirred the pot.
